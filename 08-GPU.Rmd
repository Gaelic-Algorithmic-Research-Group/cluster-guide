# GPU Usage

This section is a quick guide of using GPU nodes. More details could be found from [here](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/ResearchServices/GPUs).

Hey futuer researchers, if you want to train a Neural Net, here might be the right place! I had also struggled a bit when I first got started. 

## Quick Start

The quickest way is to login to GPU nodes and run code on top of that.

```
qlogin -l h_rt=24:00:00 -l h_vmem=16G -pe gpu 4
```

## Ask for help

Mike is really helpful when I was here. Every Thursday from 2-4 PM in 2022, we will be able to ask questions with Teams. You will be able to receive an email from Mike at that time :)
