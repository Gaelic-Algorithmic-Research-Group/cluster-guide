# Overview {-}

The University provides free resources and support for research involving high performance computing (HPC), including multiple server clusters for storing and analyzing data. Find out more information at <https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/ResearchServices/Eddie>.

This guide will help you access and use the UCSB server clusters effectively.

Use cases for HPC include:

  * big data
  * parallel computing
  * lengthy computation times
  * restricted-use data

For a broader introduction to HPC with clusters, see the HPC Carpentry's lessons at <https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/>, or work through the [exercises](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/ResearchServices/Courses)


Please acknowledge the Eddie in publications and presentations if you are using the clusters in your research.
